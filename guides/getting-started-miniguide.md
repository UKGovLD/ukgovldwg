#Getting Started

##Introduction

When you are reading this site you might get the urge to try making your own linked data and experimenting with some of your own datasets using the RDF model.  This miniguide is for you.  The goal of this miniguide is to help the entrant to the field by directing you to good training materials, to easy-to-install software, and to some manageable datasets for you to experiment with.  Now much of this is going to be based purely on the personal opinion of the writer, and, as they say, YMMV [your mileage may vary].

##The full training package
The European Union have funded the development of a comprehensive package of training materials for data practitioners as part of the 7th Framework Programme.  The [Euclid Project](http://euclid-project.eu/) has video and text training materials together with quizzes and exercises. It is not quite a MOOC in that it doesn't have a class-based tutorial system, hand-ins and such like, but it is a very broad and deep course with something for everyone.  Although designed for data practitioners, the introductory videos will also be of considerable use to those who just need the overview.


##Triplestores
There are many triplestores to choose from, and the installation of a production system involves a range of considerations that are beyond the scope of this miniguide.  However, if you just want to get access to a triplestore to experiment with then the following are examples of triplestores that have a very easy base-level installation procedure and will provide you with something suitable for experimentation purposes within a few minutes.  Please don't think though that these triplestores are just toy versions, they are all capable of production use with the appropriate installation settings.

###Fuseki
[Fuseki](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/) is a web server that provides a SPARQL query and update endpoint to a native triplestore called TDB. It is part of the Apache Jena suite. You can download the software from the [Apache Jena Releases](http://jena.apache.org/download/index.cgi) page. Installation involves simply downloading and unzipping the software and running a batch file.  The TDB triplestore is accessed through a web browser interface.  This interface enables RDF to be added to the triplestore either through SPARQL Update code entered in a web form or through the import of a file of RDF that is in any of the common text formats e.g. Turtle.  Many people use Fuseki and there is some training material on the Fuseki site an [active discussion forum ](http://jena.apache.org/help_and_support/index.html) which has helpful and responsive members.
