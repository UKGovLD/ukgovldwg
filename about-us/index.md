The Government made a commitment in the [Open Data White Paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential) to establish a new cross-government linked data working group.
The outline was for the UK Government Linked Data Working Group 'to lead the creation and maintenance of the underpinning technologies within the public sector and promote the benefits across the public sector. A key role for the group will be to work with data owners, data users and bodies such as the W3C Government Linked Data Working Group, to promote and set standards for the adoption of common URIs across government. This provision of a core of authoritative identifiers (for instance for businesses, contracts, postcodes and geo-spatial entities such as roads and bus stops) will be the key to connecting data across the information economy and allowing businesses to add value and to exchange information reliably in the digital world.'
