#
# This file specifies the organisation of a section of the site
#
# An item will appear in the menu iff
# 1) it is listed in the tree below
# 2) a valid page exists in /guides with filename as specified below
#
# ie
# - it's safe to add items to this file before the page exists
#   they will only appear in the menu when the page is there to link to
# - it's possible to have a file in the folder, published online, but not
#   included in the menu (eg index.html)
